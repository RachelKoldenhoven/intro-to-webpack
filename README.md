# Intro To Webpack

**:wave: Welcome to the _master_ branch! :wave:**

## Using this Repository

- We are using Webpack 4.x and may release a new version of this tutorial with future versions of Webpack.
- The true "entry-point" for any branch is the `README.md` - I would take a look at that before looking at anything else.
- Each branch starts where the solution branch for the previous lesson ends unless otherwise specified.
- This repository is devoloped for git-based navigation, so we've provided some shortcuts!
  - next lesson - `npm run next`
  - toggle code/solution branch - `npm run this`
  - previous lesson - `npm run previous`
- This master branch will install most of the non-webpack dependencies you need.
  - Run `npm install` if you haven't yet!
  - You will have to install the webpack-related dependencies when we get to that point
  - Robby :robot: will let you know when you need to add a dependency.
