# Intro To Webpack

:wave: Welcome to the _Webpack Merge_ branch! :wave:

[Webpack Merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge) is a great tool for managing a dynamic Webpack configuration. In this repository, you'll see how I prefer to handle my build-management.

## Steps

There are no steps, just poke around and see how things look! This branch starts off identical to the solution branch, so if you accidentally break something, feel free to reset it back to the state of the solution branch (and try not to change the solution!).
